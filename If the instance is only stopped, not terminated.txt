Option 1: Create a new key pair and replace the old one

    Create a new key pair from AWS Console and download the new .pem.

    Launch a temporary EC2 instance in the same AZ.

    Detach the root volume of the locked instance.

    Attach it to the new temporary instance as a secondary volume (e.g., /dev/xvdf).

    SSH into the temporary instance.

    Mount the attached volume:

sudo mkdir /mnt/temp
sudo mount /dev/xvdf1 /mnt/temp

Navigate to /mnt/temp/home/ec2-user/.ssh/ or the appropriate user's .ssh/ folder.

Replace authorized_keys file with your new public key.

Unmount the volume and re-attach it back to the original instance as its root volume.

Start the instance and SSH using the new key.
